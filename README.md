# CIFAR-10-PROJECT


Project Title: CIFAR-10 Image Classification

Description:
This repository contains a deep learning project for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes modules for loading and displaying the CIFAR-10 dataset, applying data augmentation, building and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and evaluating the model's performance. The code showcases best practices for image classification tasks and serves as a starting point for further experimentation and improvement.

Key Features:

Data loading and preprocessing for CIFAR-10 dataset.
Implementation of a CNN model for image classification.
Application of data augmentation techniques for improved model generalization.
Visualization of training history, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Easily extensible for experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters.
How to Use:

Clone the repository.
Run main.py to load the dataset, apply data augmentation, and train the CNN model.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
